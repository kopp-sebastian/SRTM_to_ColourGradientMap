# SRTM to ColourGradientMap
Using this script you can create gradient maps that display the height with colours out of SRTM files.

## Usage
1. Download SRTM files for a region of your choice. (for example from [here](https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/))
2. Put the files in the same folder as the script
3. Edit the script to include your specific files (I am too lazy to make it more user-friendly, sorry)
