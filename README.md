# SRTM to ColourGradientMap
With this script you can create colour gradient maps out of SRTM files.

## Usage
1. Download SRTM files for a region of your choice. (for example from [here](https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/))
2. Put the files in the same folder as the script
3. Edit the script to include your specific files (I am too lazy to make it more user-friendly, sorry)
4. Run the script
5. You have a cool-looking map :)
